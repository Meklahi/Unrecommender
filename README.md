# Unrecommender
A Chrome extension which blocks YouTube recommendations that don't come from the channel you're watching.

# Installation
Until I can get this on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it by doing the following:
1. Download the latest jQuery version - http://jquery.com/download/ (you'll want the compressed, production version)
2. Download this repository (Clone or Download -> Download ZIP), then unzip it
3. Move the compressed jQuery file you just downloaded into that folder
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Click "Load Unpacked..."
6. Select the folder you just unzipped and hit "OK"
(Only supports Google Chrome at the moment; other browsers will be supported later on!)

# Development
To help develop the Unrecommender, do the following:
1. Open your git shell and type `git clone https://github.com/memethyl/Unrecommender`
2. Download the latest jQuery version - http://jquery.com/download/ (you'll want the compressed, production version)
3. Copy that into your newly cloned repository
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Click "Load Unpacked..."
6. Select your repository folder and hit "OK"
7. Start developing!
