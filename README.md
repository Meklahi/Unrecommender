# "What about other browsers?"
The extension doesn't use any browser-specific APIs (yet), so it should work on browsers other than Chrome and Firefox.
I can't guarantee that, though, so if issues do arise, they (probably) aren't my fault. I'll look into it, though!

# To-do
- Use subscriber list on video recommendations as well as the homepage
- Add proper GUI
- Optional blacklisting/whitelisting in the future?
